# Archive

Unused/obsolete  files that don't belong in the [main repo](https://github.com/Fatih120/undernightinbirth) anymore (and to not promote downloading random exes just because).


### /exepatches

Hacked patches to the game executable with differing effects, yoinked from certain places. Reverse engineering in future progress.

- uni2patched.exe - Forgot what version it increases some sort of ID limit oops.

### /hanteichans

Various builds and forks of Hanteichan collected from certain places for different purposes that probably got outdone.

For reference, [Eiton](https://github.com/Eiton/Hantei-chan) and [DamienIsPoggers](https://github.com/DamienIsPoggers) have public repositories for their builds.

- hanteichan_interpolation.exe - Latest Eiton build, a test that allows smooth previews of interpolation effects.
- hanteichan_pat_editor.exe - Version that is apparently meant to help edit pats. Redundant.
- hanteichan_v1_MBAACC.exe - "Original" rendition of Hantei-chan, which is most properly used to open Melty Blood Actress Again HA6 files. Should not be used to mod modern games, just to reference.

### Other

- UNI2PaletteHelper.7z - Paletting tools for vanilla UNIB. Redundant for modded workflows especially once you understand how things work.
